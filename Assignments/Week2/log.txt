 Brandon Truong

To generate my public and private keys, I did

ssh brandont@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu (with PuTTY)
ls -a
mkdir .ssh
cd .ssh
ssh-keygen
(entered in filename BrandTruong and a passphrase)

To set up authorized keys on the remote server, I did

ssh brandont@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu (with PuTTY)
cd .ssh
touch authorized_keys
chmod 600 authorized_keys
cat BrandTruong.pub >> authorized_keys
cat authorized_keys | wc -l

To test the identity file, I did

(go back to lnxsrv09)
ssh -i BrandTruong brandont@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
(entered in passphrase)
exit

To use ssh-agent, I did

eval `ssh-agent`
ssh-add BrandTruong
(entered in passphrase)

To test ssh-agent, I then did

ssh -i BrandTruong brandont@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
(no passphrase needed)

To set up port forwarding, I went into PuTTY's configuration on the left side in SSH>X11 and enabled X11 Forwarding and set X display location as localhost:0.0.
I then installed xming to be able to xforward properly. I tested port forwarding by logging into lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu and using

xeyes

which gives me a picture of googly eyes that follow my mouse

To set up multihopping, I did

cd .ssh
eval `ssh-agent`
ssh-add BrandTruong
(entered in passphrase)
touch config
emacs config

and pasted in the following

Host seas
        User brandont
        HostName lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu
        Port 22
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/SEAS
        ServerAliveInterval 240
        ServerAliveCountMax 2

Host seas07
        User brandont
        HostName lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
        Port 22
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/SEAS
        ProxyCommand ssh seas -W %h:%p

Host seas06
        User brandont
        hostName lnxsrv06.seas.ucla.edu
        Port 22
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/SEAS
        ProxyCommand ssh seas07 -W %h:%p

which should allow me to connect to lnxsrv06 by using alias seas06 to multi-hop from 09 to 07 to 06. (skipping passphrase by using seas-agent before)

I also attempted multihopping by using 
ssh -A -t lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu ssh -A -t lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu ssh -A lnxsrv06.seas.ucla.edu

which should let me multi-hop with a really long line, using -A with ssh-agent to hop with Agent authentication.
