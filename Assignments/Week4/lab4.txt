1. I first did
COMMAND: wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
in order to get the tarball, then did
COMMAND: wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
COMMAND: wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg
to get the additional files

I then verified the signature by running the shell command
COMMAND: gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
which gives us the result

gpg: Signature made Wed Dec 27 10:29:05 2017 PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
gpg: Good signature from "Pdraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pdraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pdraig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 6C37 DC12 121A 5006 BC1D  B804 DF6F D971 3060 37D9

This means that while it is a valid signature, it may not be actually from 
Pdraig Brady, as someone could impersonate him. It's not a key that we have 
verified to be trusted, thus signalling that someone could've faked the key 
to make it seem like they are Brady.

2. To extract the tarball, I did
COMMAND: tar -xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
then
COMMAND: cd coreutils-8.29
to go into the directory, then
COMMAND: ./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/brandont/Desktop/coreutils
to set installation location, then
COMMAND: make
to build the executable. I then did
COMMAND: make install
to copy the built to the target install location.
Looking through the outputted text, it appears to have installed successfully

3. To reproduce the bug with coreutils, I first entered the folder with
COMMAND: cd ~/Desktop/coreutils/bin
then tested ls by using
COMMAND: ./ls ~/Desktop -aA
which prints out

.  ..  CS31  CS32  CS33  CS35L  Desktop  coreutils  datalab-handout

. and .. being the first two results, which we don't want, then the rest of 
the files
We can also call this ls by doing
COMMAND: ~/Desktop/coreutils/bin/ls ~/Desktop -aA

4. I got the patch by going to the message board and copying it into patch.diff
while inside coreutils-8.29
COMMAND: nano patch.diff

copy the bugfix snippet from the attachment:

[Snippet:start-end]
diff --git a/NEWS b/NEWS
...
+Exit $fail

COMMAND: [right-mouse-click] to paste
nano was used in place of emacs since emacs has autoindentation issues for me
I then use
COMMAND: patch -p1 < patch.diff
patching the files with the messages

patching file NEWS
Hunk #1 FAILED at 4.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file NEWS.rej
patching file src/ls.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 1900 (offset -3 lines).
patching file tests/local.mk
patching file tests/ls/a-option.sh

indicating that we patched the file, with NEWS failing since it doesn't match
with the original

5. By typing
COMMAND: make
I notice that automake is missing from my system, meaning I need to reconfigure
it
I do this by 
COMMAND: autoreconf -fi
-fi being short for force and install, which reconfigures to accept the patches
I then run
COMMAND: make
giving us the patched ls in coreutils-8.29/src (original directory)

6. Running the command
COMMAND: ls -aA ~/Desktop
inside coreutils-8.29/src thus gives us
CS31  CS32  CS33  CS35L  Desktop  coreutils  datalab-handout
which is what we want.
