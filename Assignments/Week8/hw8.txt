1. I made this file by doing 
COMMAND: emacs hw8.txt

2. using the repository from the lab, I did
COMMAND: cd diffutils
COMMAND: git checkout -b "quote" v3.0

3. I installed the patch by doing within the diffutils directory
COMMAND: patch -p1 < ~/Desktop/CS35L/Week8/quote-3.0-patch.txt

giving us:

patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

4. I read the gnu pages about add-change-log-entry-other-window with the linked provided
which uses
COMMAND: C-x 4 a

to add new entries to a change log

5. we can access the ChangeLog for the patch by doing
COMMANDS: emacs
C-x 4 a

which opens up the ChangeLog, which we can then write in:

2020-05-29  Brandon Z Truong  <brandont@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>

	* src/cmp.c: changed quotes in char strings to use ' rather than `
        * src/diff.c: changed quotes in char strings to use ' rather than `
        * src/diff3.c: changed quotes in char strings to use ' rather than `
        * src/dir.c: changed quotes in char strings to use ' rather than `
        * src/sdiff.c: changed quotes in char strings to use ' rather than `
        * src/util.c: changed quotes in char strings to use ' rather than `

6. We can then commit our changes by doing
COMMAND: git commit -a -F ChangeLog

a automatically stages all modified files to the index, while commit -f commits with the file specified as the commit message.
We then get the message:

[quote e301a28] 2020-05-29  Brandon Z Truong  <brandont@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>
 Committer: Brandon Z Truong <brandont@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>

After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:

    git commit --amend --reset-author

 6 files changed, 43 insertions(+), 43 deletions(-)

7. We can format a patch by doing
COMMAND: git format-patch -1 --stdout > ~/Desktop/CS35L/Week8/formatted-patch.txt

8. We can test this patch by then doing
COMMANDS: git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils testdiffutils
cd testdiffutils
git checkout -b patchery v3.0
git am ~/Desktop/CS35L/Week8/formatted-patch.txt

This patches our files, which we can then build and test with
COMMANDS: ./bootstrap
patch -p0 < ~/Desktop/CS35L/Week8/diffutils-gets.diff
./configure
make
make check

with the patch between bootstrap and configure being an in case due to being on lnxsrv09

We can then do
COMMANDS:
./src/diff . -
./src/diff --help

which shows the correct changes from ` to '

9. If we do
COMMAND: make distdir

we make a new dir called diffutils-3.0.1-fe00
We can then do
COMMANDS: cd diffutils-3.0.1-fe00
emacs ChangeLog

We then get our ChangeLog with the most recent result being ours:

2020-05-29  Brandon Z Truong  <brandont@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>

        2020-05-29 Brandon Z Truong <brandont@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>
                * src/cmp.c: changed quotes in char strings to use ' rather than `
                * src/diff.c: changed quotes in char strings to use ' rather than `
                * src/diff3.c: changed quotes in char strings to use ' rather than `
                * src/dir.c: changed quotes in char strings to use ' rather than `
                * src/sdiff.c: changed quotes in char strings to use ' rather than `
                * src/util.c: changed quotes in char strings to use ' rather than `

There is a repeat of date and my name since I accidentally included it in the ChangeLog and an automatic one was generated during the commit. 

10. we can open gitk by doing
COMMANDS:
ssh -Y brandont@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu
cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
gitk

which opens up gitk through x11 forwarding.
I found a merge with the Find option and the keyword 'Merge', giving us:

Author: Joakim Verona <joakim@verona.se>  2015-01-25 12:19:27
...
Merge branch 'master' into xwidget

I believe this is the most recent merge from 2015-01-25.

On the top, we see three sections. The left shows a tree with multiple branches of commits and parent relationships. The middle shows the Author of the commit. The right shows the date of the commit.

We see in the middle the SHA1 ID, the row number, and both Find and Search options.

On the bottom left, we see commit details (Author, Parent, etc) as well as diff output in their respective files. The bottom right shows an outline, from Comments to modified files.
